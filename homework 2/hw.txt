How do the two algorithms differ from each other? (Hint: how and why do they visit cells in the maze in a different order?)


The main difference between these two algorithms comes from their data structures and exploration strategies. In the stack-based algorithm, it uses a Last In, First Out (LIFO) structure, which allows it to explore deeply into one path before considering other paths. This depth-first search (DFS) approach involves popping off the newest coordinate and then attempting moves in a specific order. If it encounters a dead end, it backtracks to explore other paths. For the queue-based algorithm, it employs a First In, First Out (FIFO) structure, exploring multiple paths simultaneously. By popping off the front coordinate, it attempts to move one unit in all directions, adhering to a breadth-first search (BFS) strategy.
